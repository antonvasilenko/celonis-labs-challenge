Findouts:
contact-service
  PUT person/id
    updates the entity, full replace, sets null if prop is absent in request.
    publishes in personevents-changed: person.changed, data: personId. Not full change.
  PATCH person/id
    does same as PUT
  POST person
    does not require provided id
    publishes personevents-created: person.created, data: personId. Not full change.
  DELETE person/id
    deletes person
    publishes personevents-deleted, person.changed, data: personId.

Requirement:
  order-service should source data from contact-service and persist it in own storage.

Order-Service Requirements:
  - GET orders, have full person objects stored in order
  - POST order/ create order, accepts only ids of persons
  - DELETE order - delete all orders
  - GET order/:id - get 1 order by id
  - PUT 
  - POST, PATCH order/:id - updates order, full overide, default to null values.
  - DELETE order/:id - updates order

Order relates to Person via soldTo, billTo, shipTo.
Those are not normalized and have full props of Person, including ID.


TODOS:
[x] Learn existing solution
[x] Test contract-service api
[x] bootstrap order service, setup TS, add express server
[ ] add mongo connection and mongoose schema
[ ] complete api crud logic up to the db
[ ] error handling
[ ] latency handling
[ ] include new service in docker compose
[ ] subscribe to events from kafka streams, dummy handlers



ASSUMPTIONS:
1. For the created order, person objects should not be updated if person is updated in contact service, as those have historical value.
2. 

DECISIONS:
1. On order creation, fail creating order if persons were not resolved, otherwise order will miss critical information to be performed, like delivery address, billing info.
2. Implement retries for orderService/services/contactService.getPerson() with backoff.
3. Forbid updating ersons in order. Workaround - cancel order, create new one.
